    <h2><b>OVERVIEW</b></h2>
    <h3>
      <u>History</u>
    <p class="green">
      In the early 2000 Dreamos was an inspired idea between 2 brothers who have a love and passion for food and the business industry. With their combined ideas and thoughts the brothers have sparked an intrest in starting up their own resturant chain that specialises in their favourite cuisines that originate from European and Middle Eastern cultures. It has taken 2 years of hard work and dedication towards the planning, setting and start up of the business. On the 25th of January 2003, Dreamos opened its doors for the first time to the public and ever since, Dreamos has grown exponentially catering to diners for authentic experience. Dreamos has expanded to 7 of 9 provinces in South Africa and have been delving to the International scene. The name Dreamos orignated from the brothers dreams and passion of starting up a resturant that not only grows locally but also internationally.
